# ODE Control with Deep Q-learning

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to determine a controlling procedure for the evolution of an Ordinary Differential
Equation in a Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework, with the particular approach of Deep Q-Learning. Our study case is the Lokta Volterra system of equations, which describes how the number of individuals of a population formed by preys and predators vary due to the interaction between the two species.
